# ANAGRAM CODE KATA
### Write a program that generates the two-word anagrams of the inputted string. For example, if you input “anagrams” you should expect: (“mars + gram”, “mars + saga”, “mars + anagram”, “gram + mars”, “gram + saga”, “gram + anagram”, “saga + mars”, “saga + gram”,  “saga + anagram”, “anagram + mars”, “anagram + saga”, “anagram + gram”)
### Even though you can expect the same two words just in a different order, make sure that the same letter in the inputted word isn’t duplicated. For example, you should not get back “mama + gamma” from “anagrams”.
### If you finish early, try to optimize your solution. Maybe using parallel/multithreading and see if your tests still pass.
